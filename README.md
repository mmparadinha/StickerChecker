StickerChecker is, well... a sticker checker!


## About it

Starting a future project as Typescrypt POC.

Inspired from the 2022 World Cup Sticker Album release and from using some early incomplete apps available, we felt we could do something even better with what we have learnt the last few months.

To challenge ourselves, we decided to create our own Sticker Manager :)

Planned features:
  - Create an account
  - Mark the stickers you own (including repeated ones)
  - Register special stickers you draw (Legendaries: rookie, bronze, silver, gold)
  - Check your sticker album progress
  - List only your repeated ones
  - List only your needed ones
