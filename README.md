TrackIt is a straight forward, easy to use habit tracker!


## About it

Starting a future project as Typescrypt POC.

You often forget your desired goal or fail to realize your accomplishment so far?

Stabilishing a new habit is already demanding, so a simpler tracker won't overload the activity while improving your perception of progress!

Planned features:
  - Create an account
  - Mark the stickers you own (including repeated ones)
  - Register special stickers you draw (Legendaries: rookie, bronze, silver, gold)
  - Check your sticker album progress
  - List only your repeated ones
  - List only your needed ones
