# StickerChecker

StickerChecker is, well... a sticker checker!

## About it

Started as a Typescrypt Proof Of Concept (POC), now my first authoral project.

Inspired from the 2022 World Cup Sticker Album release, from using some early incomplete apps and by sticker trading for 3 straight hours every Saturday, I felt I could make something similar and even better with what I have learned the last few months.

To challenge and develop myself, I present my own Sticker Manager :)

### Features:
  - Create an account to save your progress
  - Easily view all your repeated, missing and owned stickers
  - Mark stickers you own (including repeated ones)
  - Mark missing stickers when you find them (trade/purchases)
  - Unmark repeated stickers when you trade them

### Planned features:
  - Check your album progress (total and by teams)
  - In a rush? Compare your stickers to another user and quickly find out which and how many you can trade
  - Register special stickers you draw (Legendaries: rookie, bronze, silver, gold)
  - Create list messages with your missing stickers and send to your friends
